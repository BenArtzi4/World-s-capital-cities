# World-s-capital-cities

This code creates a map of the countries of the world and marks the location of the capital of each country and its name.
In addition, each city receives a color according to the number of inhabitants:
1. Under 50,000 residents - green color
2. Between 50,000 and 100,000 inhabitants - orange color
3. Over 100,000 residents - red color

Code downloads a zip file from the internet, extracts the excel file which contains many cities from all over the world and filters it so that only the capital cities remain.
Next, position the city by its longitude and latitude and color my mark by the number of residents.
